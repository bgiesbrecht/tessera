# Changelog

All notable changes to Tessera are recorded here. Versioning follows the spec's evolution: the major version stays at `0` while the IR is pre-immutability (ADR-017's suspended-immutability framing applies until external dependency exists). Minor-version bumps correspond to one or more ADRs landing alongside meaningful artifact additions.

The format draws on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project additionally references ADRs (in `DECISIONS.md`) for every change of substance.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-20

RBAC support landed in the adapter cycle. The full ADR-024 four-responsibility set — emit, discover, extract, reconcile — now covers `AccessGrantConstraint` policies alongside the row/column-visibility shapes. The migration demo grew from three policies to six, with the table-grants exercise's RBAC patterns flowing through the same Snowflake → IR → UC pipeline as everything else.

### Added

**UC adapter `_emit_access_grant`** in `adapters/unity_catalog/emission.py`. Dispatches on `byIdentity` (table/function targets) vs `byScope` (schema/catalog targets). Action mapping: `Read → SELECT`, `Write → MODIFY`, `Execute → EXECUTE`. Schema/catalog grants emit `USE SCHEMA` / `USE CATALOG` scaffolding alongside the substantive privilege. Output matches the hand-derived `spec/v0/examples/table-grants.databricks.sql`.

**UC grant discovery** in `adapters/unity_catalog/discovery.py`. Walks `SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE` for each table in the schema, `SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA`, `SHOW GRANTS ON FUNCTION` for functions enumerated via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES` (the `SHOW USER FUNCTIONS IN <schema>` surface requires session-level `USE CATALOG` which the statement-execution API doesn't carry). Filters: `OWN`/`ALL PRIVILEGES`/`MANAGE` skipped as ownership noise; `USE SCHEMA`/`USE CATALOG` skipped as scaffolding; inherited grants (source object ≠ attached object) skipped (the source produces its own IR independently). Pseudo-principals (`account users`/`users`) lifted with an INFO diagnostic.

**Snowflake `_emit_access_grant`** in `adapters/snowflake/emission.py`. Parallel to UC. Snowflake-specific:

- **Schema/database read grants** expand to `GRANT USAGE` + `GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` + `GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA`. Snowflake doesn't accept `SELECT` directly on a schema; this expansion is the canonical idiom and matches Tessera's byScope downward-propagation semantics (ADR-019).
- **Function grants** require a Snowflake call signature. If the binding doesn't supply one and `config.extras["snowflake_cursor"]` is available, `_resolve_function_signature` queries `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FUNCTIONS` to look it up. Falls back to `()` placeholder with a warning.
- **Action mapping** fans out where Snowflake splits: `Write → INSERT + UPDATE + DELETE`. `Execute` on a function → `USAGE` (Snowflake's invoke privilege).

**Snowflake grant discovery** extends `adapters/snowflake/discovery.py` to walk `SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA`, `SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE` (for each table in the schema), `SHOW GRANTS ON FUNCTION` (for each function in the schema, signature resolved from `SHOW USER FUNCTIONS`).

**Snowflake grant extract** maps Snowflake privileges to IR actions: `SELECT → Read`, `INSERT/UPDATE → Write`, `DELETE → Delete`, `USAGE` on `FUNCTION → Execute`, `USAGE` on `SCHEMA/DATABASE` skipped as scaffolding, `OWNERSHIP`/`ALL` skipped.

**Migration demo extension** (`adapters/tests/live_migration_demo.py`) covers RBAC alongside row/column visibility. Six source-policy YAMLs now (three visibility shapes + three table-grants scenarios). Phase 1 provisions a `compute_customer_ltv` function and a staging schema; Phase 2 deploys all six policies on Snowflake; Phase 3 walks both `MIGRATION_DEMO` and `MIGRATION_DEMO_STAGING` for discovery; Phase 8 verifies grants on the migrated TABLE / staging-table / FUNCTION on Databricks.

### Changed

- **`AdapterConfig.bind_resource`** lookups for `byScope` now try `scope:<raw>` first (with inner prefix preserved), falling back to `scope:<stripped>`. Lets bindings be authored either way.
- **UC AccessGrantConstraint dispatch** in `emit_policy` joins the existing dispatch for the other two policy kinds.

### Fixed

- **Snowflake schema-level `GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA`** previously emitted a Snowflake-invalid statement. Now expands correctly to `GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` + `GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA`.
- **Snowflake function-grant signature resolution** previously emitted `()` placeholder which Snowflake rejected. Now resolves via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FUNCTIONS` when a cursor is available in `config.extras`.

### Empirical verification (end of cycle)

Migration demo runs end-to-end on fresh schemas both sides with all six policy shapes deploying and verifying:

| Policy kind | Target | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| RowVisibilityConstraint (group, multi-rule) | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders` | 59,998 rows visible (third branch) |
| RowVisibilityConstraint (byDataset, EXISTS) | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders_rls_acl` | 40,002 rows (caller's ACL codenames) |
| ColumnVisibilityConstraint (mask) | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders.o_clerk` | `CLERK-REDACTED` |
| AccessGrantConstraint (table) | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders` SELECT | 3 grants visible via SHOW GRANTS |
| AccessGrantConstraint (schema → all tables) | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo_staging.staged_orders` SELECT | 1 grant visible via SHOW GRANTS |
| AccessGrantConstraint (function) | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.compute_customer_ltv` EXECUTE | 1 grant visible via SHOW GRANTS |

### Issue tracker activity

No issues filed or closed in this cycle. The migration-demo's RBAC capability now empirically validates the AccessGrantConstraint policyKind from 0.4.0 (ADR-026, closed #15).

### What this version does not include

- **UC ABAC byScope column-mask emission** ([#30](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/30)) — sibling of byScope row-filter from 0.3.0.
- **Snowflake ABAC byScope** ([#31](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/31)) — different platform mechanism.
- **Phase 2 scoping docs for #19/#21/#25** — queued for claude.ai.
- **Schema-pattern resource bindings** — today the demo enumerates per-table bindings when migrating schema-scoped grants. A pattern-binding feature ("any table in schema X maps to corresponding table in schema Y") would reduce the binding boilerplate.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-20

Three-commit increment focused on adapter-contract completeness and the documentation debt that emerged from the 0.4.0 migration cycle. The full ADR-024 adapter responsibility set — discover, extract, emit, reconcile — is now real on both Unity Catalog and Snowflake (modulo ABAC byScope shapes that remain queued under separate issues). Five issues closed.

### Added

**Unity Catalog `discover()` and `extract()` — `adapters/unity_catalog/discovery.py`.**

Parallel to the Snowflake equivalent. discover() walks `SHOW TABLES IN <schema>` + `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED` to inventory row filters and column masks attached to tables; fetches each function's body via `DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED`. extract() recognizes three body shapes that the UC adapter emits:

- byDataset row filter (`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM <map> m JOIN <acl> p WHERE m.<user> = current_user() AND p.<col> = <param>)`).
- byIdentity multi-OR row filter (`is_account_group_member('A') OR (is_account_group_member('B') AND col IN (…))`).
- byIdentity column mask (`CASE WHEN is_account_group_member('X') THEN col ELSE 'literal' END`).

Live-verified against `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo`: all three deployed policies discovered and extracted with confidence ≥ 0.9. The adapter stays SDK-agnostic — caller supplies a `run_sql` callable via `config.extras["run_sql"]`. Closes [#27](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/27).

**Platform-neutral `reconcile()` — `adapters/contract/reconcile.py`.**

The fourth ADR-024 responsibility, implemented as a default on `Adapter` so both adapters get it without per-adapter code. Composes the adapter's `discover()` + `extract()` to produce an observed IR snapshot, then runs a structural diff against the supplied intended corpus. Returns a `ReconciliationResult` with `additions` / `removals` / `modifications` plus surfaced extraction diagnostics.

Matching is by `(appliesTo.resource, action)` key, case-folded on the identifier portion of `prefix:id` strings. The diff compares only structural fields (`policyKind`, `action`, `defaultStrategy`, `rules`, `defaultBranch`) — descriptive fields (`@id`, `description`, `provenance`) are noise for reconcile purposes.

Live-verified against `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo`: 0 additions, 0 removals, 3 modifications (the modifications reflect real differences between the source YAMLs and the migration-bindings-translated deployed form). Closes [#26](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/26).

### Changed (documentation)

- **`docs/user-guide/contributing.md` § Design rules every adapter must follow** gains the UDF parameter-name collision convention. Bug was fixed in three emission paths during 0.3.0 and 0.4.0; the convention now lives in the authoring docs so future emission paths don't reintroduce it. Closes [#28](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/28).
- **`docs/user-guide/operating.md` § Identifier case in extracted IR** documents the chosen convention: carry source-platform case verbatim in extracted IR; rely on `AdapterConfig.bind_principal` / `bind_resource` case-insensitivity (added 0.4.0) as the bridge. Closes [#29](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/29).
- **`docs/technical-design-v0.2.md` §5.5a — Emission readability** documents the negated-complement → readable-ELSE expectation. Largely automatic post-ADR-014 (`defaultBranch` is structural); remains a quality expectation for pre-container IR shapes. Closes [#5](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/5).

### Issue tracker activity

- **Closed**: [#5](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/5), [#26](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/26), [#27](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/27), [#28](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/29).
- **Comments added** to touched-but-not-closed issues: [#8](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/8) (binding-layer fix vs IR-level vocabulary distinction), [#13](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/13) (migration-demo workaround), [#14](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/14) (extractor collapses Intent A/B).
- **Filed** at the start of this cycle: [#26](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/26)–[#31](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/31) — six new issues capturing gaps the 0.4.0 migration cycle surfaced. Four of these closed during 0.5.0; #30 (UC ABAC byScope column-mask) and #31 (Snowflake ABAC byScope) remain.
- 31 total issues; 10 closed; 21 open at version close.

### What this version does not include

- **ABAC byScope emission gaps remain queued.** [#30](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/30) (UC column-mask) and [#31](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/31) (Snowflake row + column) cover the remaining adapter coverage gaps.
- **Tessera CLI thin wrapper** — converter's `python -m tools.converter` is still the only command-line surface.
- **Phase 2 scoping documents for #19 / #21 / #25** — queued for claude.ai.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-20

Five-commit increment focused on closing the migration cycle: `discover` and `extract` on Snowflake are no longer stubs, `byDataset` row visibility is implemented on both adapters, and the full Snowflake → Unity Catalog migration runs end-to-end on fresh schemas with adapter-applied bindings carrying the platform translation. ADR-026 adds `AccessGrantConstraint` as the fifth v0 policyKind, closing the table-grants exercise's open question.

### Added

**Spec.**
- **ADR-026** — `AccessGrantConstraint` policyKind added to v0 across `ontology.ttl`, `context.jsonld`, `schema.json`, and `shapes.ttl`. Affirmative-grant policies (`effect: allow` on rules) now have an honest policyKind rather than squeezing into `RowVisibilityConstraint`. Three table-grants exercise YAMLs migrated to the new shape; JSON-LDs regenerated via the v1 converter; all 11 worked-example policies still validate clean. Closes [#15](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/15).

**Adapter responsibilities (no longer stubs).**
- **`SnowflakeAdapter.discover(database, schema)`** inventories row-access policies, masking policies, and their attachments on a target schema. Walks `SHOW {ROW ACCESS,MASKING} POLICIES`, `DESCRIBE` for bodies, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.POLICY_REFERENCES` for attachments.
- **`SnowflakeAdapter.extract(artifact)`** lifts a discovered Snowflake policy into Tessera IR. Pattern-driven over the policy body text; recognizes three shapes the worked exercises have deployed: byDataset / EXISTS-with-mapping-table row-access policies, byIdentity / IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION-branched row-access policies, byIdentity / CASE-WHEN-IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION masking policies. Extracted IR validates against schema + SHACL with confidence ≥ 0.9.

**Adapter emission coverage.**
- **UC byDataset row-visibility emission** — `_emit_row_visibility_by_dataset` produces the row-filter UDF body matching the hand-derived `spec/v0/examples/acl-row-visibility.databricks.sql`. `CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM map JOIN acl ... WHERE m.user = current_user() AND p.col = <param>)` + `ALTER TABLE ... SET ROW FILTER`. Uses a fixed parameter alias (`policy_input_value`) to avoid the case-insensitive-identifier collision that would otherwise degenerate the predicate to `col = col` (always TRUE — the bug the second deploy uncovered).

**Tooling.**
- **`adapters/tests/live_snowflake_to_uc_migration.py`** — the first round-trip migration runner. Discovers the policies already deployed on `BRICETEST.TESSERA`, extracts to IR, emits UC DDL, deploys on `bg_rls_demo.tpch`, verifies behavior under the calling user.
- **`adapters/tests/live_migration_demo.py`** — the repeatable, clean-schemas-both-sides migration demo. Eight phases from fresh-Snowflake-schema provisioning through Databricks verification, plus `--cleanup` to teardown. Idempotent; safe to re-run. The runnable answer to the "could we migrate Snowflake → UC by end of day" aspiration.

**Documentation.**
- **`docs/user-guide/scenarios/migrating-snowflake-to-uc.md`** — practitioner-shaped walkthrough of the five-phase migration cycle, with the empirical results from both runs and the two findings the exercise produced as adapter improvements (resource_bindings for data tables; parameter-naming collision in the row-filter UDF).

### Changed

- **`AdapterConfig.bind_principal` / `bind_resource`** are now case-insensitive on the identifier portion after the IRI prefix. Snowflake stores identifiers uppercase; extracted IRs come back uppercase; bindings authored mixed-case would otherwise miss. IRI prefix (`table:`, `column:`, `group:`) stays case-sensitive — the semantic discriminator must not collide.
- **Snowflake byDataset row-visibility emission** now consults `bind_resource()` for the data-table references inside the policy body (mapping table, ACL table). Parallel to the UC fix from earlier in the day. Without this the emitted Snowflake DDL would carry the IR's literal table names (Databricks-shaped) and fail on Snowflake.
- **UC adapter dispatch on the `rules[].principal.selector` axis**: when all rules use `byDataset`, the row-visibility emission routes to `_emit_row_visibility_by_dataset` instead of the byIdentity path.
- **Three `table-grants-scenario-*` artifacts** migrated from `RowVisibilityConstraint + effect: allow` to `AccessGrantConstraint`. JSON-LDs regenerated via the converter.
- **`table-grants.diagnostic.md` §3.4** marked RESOLVED by ADR-026.

### Fixed

- **Row-filter parameter-name collision in UC byDataset emission.** The function parameter `O_ORDERPRIORITY` collided with the bare `o_orderpriority` column reference inside the `EXISTS` subquery; SQL is case-insensitive on identifiers, so Databricks resolved the bare identifier to the column reference, the predicate degenerated to `col = col` (always TRUE), and the filter passed everything. First deployment surfaced 7.5M visible rows; the second deployment with the fix correctly returned only the caller-permitted priorities. Same gotcha the Snowflake adapter solved in 0.2.0; same fix.

### Empirical verification (end of day)

The repeatable migration demo (`adapters/tests/live_migration_demo.py`) runs the full 8-phase cycle on fresh schemas. Under the calling user (`brice.giesbrecht@databricks.com`, in `account users` only):

| Policy | Target object | Visible result |
|---|---|---|
| Group row visibility | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders` | 59,998 rows (priorities 3-MEDIUM / 4-NOT SPECIFIED / 5-LOW — third branch fires) |
| byDataset row visibility | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders_rls_acl` | 40,002 rows (priorities 1-URGENT + 2-HIGH — caller's ACL codenames) |
| Column mask | `bg_rls_demo.migration_demo.demo_orders.o_clerk` | `'CLERK-REDACTED'` for all distinct values |

### Issue tracker activity

- **Closed**: [#15](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/15) (access-grant-constraint-policykind) by ADR-026.
- **Open at version close**: #3, #4, #5, #7, #8, #9, #11, #12, #13, #14, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25.
- 25 total issues; 5 closed; 20 open.

### What this version does not include

- **`adapters/reconcile()`** still stubbed on both adapters. The full discover/extract/emit/reconcile cycle is three-of-four real now.
- **UC ABAC byScope column-mask emission** still queued. The byScope row-filter path landed in 0.3.0; the column-mask sibling remains the matching coverage gap.
- **Snowflake ABAC byScope** (row + column) — different platform mechanism (object tags + tag-based policy attachment). Out of scope for this version.
- **Tessera CLI thin wrapper** — converter's `python -m tools.converter` is the only command-line surface today; a unified CLI is a deferred convenience.
- **Phase 2 scoping documents for #19/#21/#25** — queued for claude.ai to draft.
- **Reverse-direction extraction shapes** beyond the three the project's worked exercises have deployed. Production extraction would need a SQL AST parser; the regex-driven extractor handles known shapes and reports diagnostics on the rest.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-20

Five-commit increment on top of 0.2.0. New tool (YAML → JSON-LD converter), three new adapter emission paths (UC column visibility, UC ABAC byScope row visibility, Snowflake column visibility), new practitioner-shaped tutorial, new W3C-savvy overview, 10 new tracked issues from the governance-gap survey, and the worked-example corpus regenerated with YAML as canonical source.

### Added

**Tools.**
- `tools/converter/` — Python YAML → JSON-LD converter. v1 accepts both envelope-form (`policy: { id, kind, … }`) and flat-form YAML. Mechanical mapping (envelope unwrap, `id → @id` with `policy:` prefix, `kind → policyKind`, context-aware `type → @type`, canonical `@context` injection, trailing-whitespace normalization). CLI: `python -m tools.converter <file> [--out path]`. Library: `tools.converter.yaml_to_jsonld(path)` / `yaml_to_jsonld_str(text)` / `convert_file(in, out)`. Uses `ruamel.yaml` from the start so comment preservation (deferred to v2) is a one-step addition. Regression test covers all 11 worked-example YAMLs.

**Adapter coverage.**
- UC `ColumnVisibilityConstraint` emission — `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` returning the masked value, `GRANT EXECUTE` adapter scaffolding (per ADR-025 boundary), `ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN … SET MASK`. Live-verified against `bg_rls_demo.tpch.orders.o_clerk`. Covers byIdentity column targets; Redact transformation; Mask/Hash emit `NULL` placeholders pending future scaffold passes.
- UC ABAC byScope `RowVisibilityConstraint` emission — three-piece DDL: `CREATE FUNCTION` with Mechanism B CASE body, `GRANT EXECUTE`, `CREATE POLICY … ON CATALOG/SCHEMA/TABLE … ROW FILTER … FOR TABLES MATCH COLUMNS has_tag_value(<tag_key>, <tag_value>) AS alias USING COLUMNS (alias)`. Exercises `AdapterConfig.tag_taxonomy` (ADR-021). Live-verified against `bg_rls_demo.tpch.orders_abac`.
- Snowflake `ColumnVisibilityConstraint` emission — `CREATE OR REPLACE MASKING POLICY … AS (col VARCHAR) RETURNS VARCHAR -> CASE … END` plus `ALTER TABLE … MODIFY COLUMN … SET MASKING POLICY`. Live-verified against `BRICETEST.TESSERA.SNOW_ORDERS.O_CLERK` with `USE SECONDARY ROLES NONE`; role-discrimination is Intent B (IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION) per Snowflake's recommendation and issue #14.

**Documentation.**
- `docs/w3c-overview.md` — semantic-web-savvy overview of how the project uses OWL, JSON-LD 1.1, SHACL, SKOS, and the W3C stack. Shows the architecture honestly without overclaiming (no SPARQL in eval, no OWL DL reasoning, no formal vocabulary imports, no standards-body submission).
- `docs/user-guide/scenarios/acl-and-masking.md` — practitioner-shaped tutorial for the "ACL-table row visibility + column masking with a group exception" situation. Assumes YAML literacy; no semantic-web background required. Walks through two policies end to end including converter invocation and per-platform deployment.
- User-guide README routes practitioners to the scenario tutorial first.

**Issue tracker.**
- 10 governance-gap issues filed (#16–#25) from claude.ai's top-10 governance-need survey. Three flagged as in-scope gaps with scoping docs queued for Phase 2 (#19 audit logging, #21 retention — most urgent, #25 AI governance); the remaining seven captured coverage-confirmed, out-of-scope, underexercised, or integration-question dispositions for tracking visibility.
- 8 new labels created on the repo: `governance-need`, `coverage-confirmed`, `in-scope-gap`, `out-of-scope`, `underexercised`, `integration-question`, `scoping-needed`, `v0-candidate`.

**Tests.**
- `adapters/tests/test_parity.py::test_column_visibility_parity_emits_clean_on_both_adapters` — same IR, both adapters, each emits its native column-mask primitive, output meaningfully different.

### Changed

- **All 11 worked-example JSON-LDs regenerated from their YAML sources via the converter.** The corpus is canonical-YAML-driven going forward. Eliminates the descriptive-field drift the converter's regression test surfaced (5 of 11 files had prose differences between hand-maintained YAML and JSON-LD). Net diff: 60 insertions / 98 deletions across 11 files; no semantic content lost. The converter's deterministic compact output replaces hand-formatted spacing.
- `adapters/snowflake/capability.py` ROW_VISIBILITY rationale rewritten to record the role-discrimination-semantics distinction (Intent A vs B per issue #14), correcting an earlier "DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES is a gotcha" framing.
- `adapters/unity_catalog/capability.py` ATTRIBUTE_BASED_SCOPING rationale records that ABAC row visibility is now implemented and live-verified; ABAC column masking via byScope remains the queued stub on this axis.
- `adapters/snowflake/capability.py` COLUMN_VISIBILITY rationale records live verification with per-role row counts.
- `adapters/unity_catalog/capability.py` COLUMN_VISIBILITY rationale records live verification.
- `DECISIONS.md` ADR-024 postscript refined per claude.ai's design review: Snowflake secondary-roles finding is an adapter emission choice (Intent A vs Intent B), not a platform misfeature.
- `docs/user-guide/{authoring,tutorial,evaluating}.md` updated to reflect converter v1 landing (was "queued" in three places).
- `CLAUDE.md` Priority 5 section marked complete with deferred items called out; eight-exercise list grew to include the table-grants Phase 3 plus the cross-platform live runs.

### Issue tracker activity

- Filed: [#16](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/16)–[#25](https://github.com/bgiesbrecht/tessera/issues/25) (governance-gap survey).
- Open at version close: #3, #4, #5, #7, #8, #9, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25.
- Closed prior to this version: #1, #2, #6, #10.
- 25 total issues; 4 closed; 21 open.

### What this version does not include

- **ABAC byScope column-mask emission on UC** — IR shapes exist (`abac-column-mask-policy-*`) but adapter still warns `UNIMPLEMENTED_SELECTOR_FOR_COLUMN_VISIBILITY` for byScope. Queued.
- **Snowflake ABAC byScope** (row or column) — different platform mechanism (object tags + masking-policy-attached-to-tag); deferred to a future scoping pass.
- **Adapter discover / extract / reconcile implementations** — all stubs; blocks the migration story until they're real.
- **Tessera CLI thin wrapper** — none yet; deployment remains library-shaped Python. The converter's CLI entry (`python -m tools.converter`) is the only command-line surface.
- **Phase 2 scoping documents for #19/#21/#25** — queued for claude.ai to draft.
- **JSON-LD → YAML converter direction** — deferred to v2; v1 covers the practitioner authoring direction only.
- **Comment preservation in YAML round-trips** — deferred to v2 per ADR-004; v1's `ruamel.yaml` foundation makes this a one-step addition rather than a refactor.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19

Substantial inflection: spec v0 reaches feature-complete-for-the-current-evidence-corpus, first adapter scaffolds land for two platforms simultaneously, first cross-platform live exercises run end to end, full user documentation lands. The morning's `e8a1422` "Checkpoint" commit was the previous state; everything below is what was added on top.

### Added

**Spec.**
- `spec/v0/shapes.ttl` — SHACL shapes for semantic validation. All eight worked-example JSON-LDs validate; seven negative tests catch unknown policyKind / action / selector / effect / defaultStrategy / condition op / canonical-axis IRI.
- `Execute` well-known action — across `ontology.ttl`, `context.jsonld`, `schema.json`, `shapes.ttl`. Semantic-only scope (gating who can invoke business-logic resources); platform-mechanism EXECUTE uses remain adapter scaffolding. (ADR-025)
- Stage 4 ABAC vocabulary in `spec/v0/ontology.ttl`, `context.jsonld`, `schema.json` — implements ADRs 018–021. `tessera:AttributeAxis` class; four well-known axes (`sensitivityAxis` hierarchical; `dataSubjectAxis`, `regulatoryRegimeAxis`, `businessDomainAxis` flat); `byScope` selector with `scope` / `except` / `matching` properties; `AttributeMatcher` class.

**Adapters.**
- `adapters/contract/` — `Adapter` ABC, `CapabilityProfile` (closed `Capability` enum), `AdapterConfig` (with `identity_bindings`, `resource_bindings`, `tag_taxonomy`, `extras`), structured Result types (`EmissionResult`, `DiscoveryResult`, `ExtractionResult`, `ReconciliationResult`), `Diagnostic` with severity / code / message / location. (ADR-024)
- `adapters/unity_catalog/` — Databricks adapter scaffold; emission live for group-driven row visibility via `is_account_group_member` + `SET ROW FILTER`.
- `adapters/snowflake/` — Snowflake adapter scaffold; emission live for `byIdentity` row visibility (via `IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION` + `ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY`) and for `byDataset` row visibility (via `EXISTS(...)` against ACL mapping tables, gating on `CURRENT_USER()`).
- `adapters/tests/test_parity.py` — same IR → both adapters → meaningfully different SQL; structural fixture for the contract.
- `adapters/tests/live_databricks.py`, `live_snowflake.py`, `live_snowflake_bydataset.py` — runnable cross-platform live exercises.
- `adapters/tests/setup_table_grants.py` — idempotent workspace provisioner for the table-grants exercise.

**Worked exercises (eight total, three added in this version).**
- **Cross-platform live emission** — same IR (`group-row-visibility-policy-a`) lowered through both adapters; both row filters enforce correctly on Databricks (7.5M rows) and Snowflake (1.5M rows). Drove `AdapterConfig.resource_bindings` and the empirical reframing of Snowflake secondary-roles behavior.
- **Snowflake `byDataset` row visibility** — `BRICETEST.TESSERA.SNOW_ORDERS_RLS_ACL`; four scenarios pass including secondary-roles immunity (`USE SECONDARY ROLES NONE` and `ALL` produce identical row counts because `CURRENT_USER()` ignores role activation). Surfaced one v1 candidate (#13).
- **Table-grants RBAC** — three scenarios (single-table read, schema-level read with propagation, function execute). Drove ADR-025 (`Execute`) and surfaced #15 (`AccessGrantConstraint` candidate). Closed #10 (policy-execute-grants).

Previously committed exercise artifacts (group, ACL, column-mask, ABAC column-mask, ABAC row-filter) now live in `spec/v0/examples/` alongside the new ones.

**Documentation.**
- `docs/user-guide/` — six-page user documentation: README (audience routing), tutorial (end-to-end walkthrough), authoring (vocabulary reference + Snowflake byDataset recommendation), operating (adapter config + per-platform checklists), evaluating (scope, non-goals, decision framework), contributing (ADR discipline, adapter extension, exercise methodology).
- `docs/handoffs/2026-05-19-claude-ai-update.md` — synchronization point for the design-partner / implementor collaboration.
- `docs/exercises/` — Phase 1 inputs for the worked exercises (group, ACL, column-mask, ABAC column-mask, ABAC row-filter, Snowflake byDataset, table-grants).
- `docs/v1-candidates/abac-and-attribute-axes.md` — ABAC scoping document that drove ADRs 018–021.

### Changed

- **ADR-024 postscript reframed** the Snowflake secondary-roles finding as an adapter emission choice (Intent A vs Intent B for role discrimination) rather than a platform "gotcha." Initial framing conflated policy intent ambiguity with platform configuration assumption; corrected after claude.ai design-review. Three artifacts re-framed accordingly: `adapters/snowflake/capability.py` ROW_VISIBILITY entry, ADR-024 postscript finding #3, `docs/user-guide/operating.md` § Role-discrimination semantics.
- **`AdapterConfig.resource_bindings` field added** during the first cross-platform live exercise. Mirrors `identity_bindings` for resources; the same IR target can lower to different platform identifiers per environment.
- **CLAUDE.md state refresh** — eight exercises listed; ADRs 017–025 noted; adapter section updated to "complete (scaffold)"; spec section updated to "post-Stage-4."
- **Snowflake capability profile rationale** — sharpened with the role-discrimination-semantics distinction, with empirical verification of the `DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES` finding (user property, not session parameter).
- **Technical design v0.2** — §3.3 / §3.3a / §4.9 / §4.10 / §5.6 / §5.7 added/updated for ABAC vocabulary, Mechanism A vs B observation, adapter configuration mapping pattern, cross-policy conflict detection.

### Fixed

- **ADR-022** corrected ADR-016's over-tight transformation constraint: `transformation` is required iff `effect: transform`, not for all `ColumnVisibilityConstraint` rules. Effect-driven, not policy-kind-driven.

### ADRs landed in this version

- **ADR-017** — Immutability bar suspended until external dependency exists (supersedes ADR-014's date-based framing).
- **ADR-018** — `AttributeAxis` and the Classification refactor.
- **ADR-019** — Scoped policy attachment via `byScope`.
- **ADR-020** — Composable attribute matching reuses `byComposition`.
- **ADR-021** — Adapter configuration mapping pattern.
- **ADR-022** — Transformation constraint is effect-driven.
- **ADR-023** — Cross-policy combination resolution: γ-with-refinement.
- **ADR-024** — Adapter contract shape, plus postscript with live-cross-platform findings and the refined role-discrimination framing.
- **ADR-025** — `Execute` action added to v0 with semantic-vs-mechanism boundary.

## [0.1.x] — prior to 2026-05-19

Pre-versioning era. Captured here as a single block by reference; the detailed history is in the commit log up to and including `e8a1422` ("Checkpoint"). Key milestones from that period:

- Repository established; canonical name and license decisions (ADRs).
- v0 spec drafted: `spec/v0/ontology.ttl`, `spec/v0/context.jsonld`, `spec/v0/schema.json`.
- First three worked exercises completed (group row-visibility A/B, ACL row-visibility, column-mask on `o_clerk`).
- ADRs 001–016 landed: project framing and posture, three-form IR shape (YAML / JSON-LD / DSL), adapter-first architecture, ODRL/DPV alignment, deferred DSL, well-known IRI conventions, policy container (ADR-014), ordered first-match (ADR-015), transformation parameterization (ADR-016).
- ABAC scoping document drafted (`docs/v1-candidates/abac-and-attribute-axes.md`); two additional ABAC worked exercises ran.

For the per-commit narrative of this period, see `git log --oneline` from the initial commit through `e8a1422`.
